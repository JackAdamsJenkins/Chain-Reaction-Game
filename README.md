# Game Description:

In Chain Reaction, two players take turns drawing colored blocks from a grid. 
The goal is to create a chain of identical colors to remove from the grid, scoring points for each removed block. 
However, players must also manage the blocks already placed on the grid to avoid creating unwanted chains or "barriers" that block their opponent's moves.
